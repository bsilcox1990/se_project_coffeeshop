This is the second project of the Software Engineering program at TripleTen. It was created using HTML and CSS, based on the design brief.

## Project features

- Semantic HTML5
- Flexbox
- Positioning
- Flat BEM file structure
- A custom form
- CSS animation and transform

## What the project does
- first page is the home page where all the navigation links are located that take you to the different sections of the page
- second page uses iFrames to add video instructions on how to make different recipes
- the third page is a form for making a reservation which includes a submit button and a terms of use checkbox, all of the inputs are set to required before being able to submit.
- the fourth page is the menu items available at the coffee shop and their corresponding prices. makes use of a custom span tag in order to provide an underline between the item and price.
- the fifth page is the about page for the coffee shop explaining all the perks. It has an animation making use of the keyframes function in css.
- the last page is the footer which features links to different social media pages(not currently functional)

## Plan on improving the project

I was unable to apply the different styles to the checkbox and would like to work on understanding how in the future.
I would like to add more animations because they really bring the webpage to life.
More hover effects would make the user have a better interactive experience.
